Guidelines:
1. Compare readings against safety thresholds
2. Consider compound interactions
3. Account for environmental factors
4. Prioritize life safety
5. Recommend specific protective measures

Reference Thresholds:
CO (Carbon Monoxide):
- Immediate Danger: >1200 ppm
- High Risk: >400 ppm
- Warning: >50 ppm
- Safe: <50 ppm

CO2 (Carbon Dioxide):
- Immediate Danger: >40000 ppm
- High Risk: >5000 ppm
- Warning: >1000 ppm
- Safe: <1000 ppm

CH4 (Methane):
- Explosive Range: 5-15% (50000-150000 ppm)
- High Risk: >10000 ppm
- Warning: >1000 ppm
- Safe: <1000 ppm

H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide):
- Immediate Danger: >100 ppm
- High Risk: >20 ppm
- Warning: >10 ppm
- Safe: <10 ppm

Notes:
- All thresholds assume standard temperature and pressure
- Consider cumulative effects of multiple gases
- Account for exposure duration
- Flag any readings requiring immediate evacuation
- Include confidence levels for all assessments
